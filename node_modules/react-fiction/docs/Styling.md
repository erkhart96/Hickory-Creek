# Styling

To make styling easier, the components included in `react-fiction` have various classes set on them.

| Class name    | Component |
| ------------- | --------- |
| `react-fiction-story` | [`Story`](api/Story.md) |
| `react-fiction-viewer` | [`Viewer`](api/Viewer.md) |
| `react-fiction-link` | [`Link`](api/Link.md) |
| `react-fiction-passage` | [`Passage`](api/Passage.md) |

As well, there is a set of default styles included with `react-fiction`. They are in `react-fiction/styles/default.css`. You can import these through something like Webpack, directly access them in the `node_modules` folder, or just copy them out.
